				<h3 id="talk_thales">Augmenting requirements with models to improve the articulation between system
					engineering levels and optimize V&V practices</h3>
				<p>Model-based systems engineering has developed significantly over the last few years, resulting in an
					increased usage of models in systems specification and architecture description. The question of the
					positioning of requirement engineering versus MBSE is a recurrent one.</p>
				<p>This talk describes one vision of this articulation where textual and model requirements actually
					complete each other. The results are improved contracts across engineering levels and more
					formalized V&V practices.</p>

				<p>Open source software like Capella comes with advantages like the easy way to extend or customize it and drawbacks including support to users especially when they are working in a collaborative way. This presentation will share how Capella has been deployed in Framatome so that systems engineer/architect do not care much about technical issues but remain focus on their business.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, in a context where many companies have their data described in excel files, XLS Pivot (part our MBSE Suite tool), is a generic MBSE solution developed by Framatome on top of Capella to help users to exchange data from Excel to Capella and vice versa. This presentation will show XLS Pivot in action. </p>

				<p>The main reason we do product architecture is to communicate to downstream product development what they need to build, thus the need to integrate the Capella product architecture with the product lifecycle through PLM (Product Lifecycle Management).  Siemens’ Teamcenter PLM is used by millions of developers around the world in thousands of organizations.  Capella is being integrated with Teamcenter enabling it to actively participate in the product lifecycle to drive the entire product development process.</p>
				<p>This session will provide an update on Siemens’ PLM integration progress and demonstrate the value of a Capella enabled product lifecycle.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h3 id="talk_glaway">Model Execution and System Simulation in Capella</h3>
				<p>A common need in system architecture design is to verify that if the architect is correct and can
					satisfy its requirements. Execution of system architect model means to interact with state machines
					to test system’s control logic. It can verify if the logical sequences of functions and interfaces
					in different scenarios are desired.</p>
				<p>However, only sequence itself is not enough to verify its consequence or output. So we need each
					function to do what it is supposed to do during model execution to verify its output, and that is
					what we called “system simulation”.</p>
				<p>This presentation introduces how we do model execution in Capella, and how to embed digital mockup
					inside functions to do “system simulation” with a higher confidence.</p>

				<h3 id="talk_obeo">Integrating Capella with your own ecosystem of tools</h3>
				<p>The current industrial trends related, among others, to digital twins or large scale systems of
					systems, drive companies to using MBSE tools such as Capella. However, these tools have to be part
					of the overall ecosystem of tools used by such companies (e.g. complex systems manufacturers).</p>
				<p>One example is the integration with a PLM solution, that we will illustrate by explaining how we have
					integrated Capella and Teamcenter by developping System Modeling Workbench.</p>
				<p>Beyond technical aspects (build the product, managing its lifecycle with regards to constraints
					brought by the market and by the open source processes, etc.) we will also discuss the organization
					of the collaboration needed to perform this kind of integration project.</p>

					By capturing the design choices in Capella (periodic/sporadic events, precedence relation between
					tasks, network communication between resources, mutual exclusion resources, etc.), Tideal viewpoint
					not only allows to compute the worst-case execution time for end-to-end flows traversing the system
					but also provides some feedback to the architect to better understand the temporal behavior of the

				<h3 id="talk_siemens_ct">Model-based safety analysis on Capella using Component Fault Trees (CFTs)</h3>
				<p>The importance of mission or safety-critical software systems in many application domains of embedded
					systems is continuously growing, and so is the effort and complexity for reliability and safety
					analysis. Model-based system engineering (MBSE) is currently one of the key approaches to cope with
					increasing system complexity.</p>
				<p>With Component Fault Trees (CFTs) there is a model- and component-based methodology for safety
					analysis, which extends the advantages of model-based development to safety & reliability
					engineering. In this talk, we demonstrate how to ease the development of safety-critical systems in
					industrial practice by extending MBSE in Capella with model-based safety analysis using Component
					Fault Tree methodology.</p>

				<h3 id="talk_pure_systems">MBSE & PLE: Systematic Reuse of Capella Models with pure::variants</h3>
				<p>In domains that deal with the development of complex systems consisting of software and hardware it is often a challenge to find an efficient and holistic reuse strategy for existing engineering assets that allows to keep the engineering competitiveness high even though a growing number of markets and specific customer needs shall be covered by a product family.
				<br/>Product Line Engineering (PLE) is a well-known approach to address this challenge. In this session we will cover how PLE and MBSE can be brought together using the open-source MBSE solution Capella in combination with the Variant Management tool pure::variants to implement a systematic reuse of system architecture across multiple product variants.</p>

				<h3 id="talk_the_reuse_company">Capella integration with RAT - Authoring Tools</h3>
				<p>When it comes to writing and managing requirements aligned with models in Capella, RAT, the Rich Authoring Tool from the REUSE Company, is the perfect companion.
				RAT provides AI and Natural Language Processing (a complete Semantic approach) to <b>write the perfect requirements</b>. The following functions are offered by RAT for Capella plug-in:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Quality</b>: real-time quality assessment of rules such as the
						ones defined in the INCOSE Guide for Writing Requirements, the
						NASA Handbook, the ECSS rules followed by the Space industry, or
						others.</li>
					<li><b>Consistency</b>: using a set of patterns to come out with a
						consistent structure for your requirements across the
						organization.</li>
					<li><b>Requirements-Models traceability and integration</b>:
						requirements and models will always be integrated. RAT offers the
						names of the models in Capella to fill the placeholders as defined
						and agreed in the patterns, keeping a link to automatically change
						your requirements when the elements are renamed or edited.</li>
					<li><b>Round-trip</b>: bidirectional connectivity between Capella and
						DOORS, allowing adding or editing requirements in IBM DOORS
						seamlessly using the elements defined in a Capella model, make the
						most of the capabilities offered by DOORS and then synchronize
						your requirements back to Capella keeping all the references to
						the Capella elements and sections.</li>
					<li><b>Accessibility</b>: RAT aggregates requirements in a <b>SMART Grid</b>
						in Capella. Different grids can be shown based on the selection of
						elements in the model. The grid provides shorting, filtering,
						advanced search, or quality rates for each elements, among many
						other functionalities.</li>
					<li><b>Integration with the SES Suite of REUSE Company</b>: RAT for
						Capella plug-in is fully integrated with RQA - Quality Studio to
						tailor the quality rules, or check the completeness and
						consistency analysis between requirements and models. RAT for
						Capella is also fully integrated with KM – Knowledge Manager to
						provide additional content to your data dictionary or to tailor
						the patterns used by RAT.</li>
