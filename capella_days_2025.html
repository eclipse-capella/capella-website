					<h3>The S80 Submarine Systems Engineering Journey</h3>
					<span class="descr">TUESDAY 18th of NOVEMBER | 3:35 pm UTC+1&nbsp;&nbsp;<button class="tag">Defense</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">Sustainment</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">RAMS</button></span>
					<p></p>
					<p>"The presentation focuses on the comprehensive approach taken by Navantia in the systems engineering of the development and sustainment of the S80 submarine program while demonstrating the use of Capella MBSE software and the ARCADIA methodology in the process.</p>
					<p>The main objective of the presentation is to showcase the methodologies and strategies employed by Navantia to ensure the efficient and effective sustainment of the S80 submarine fleet after the sustainment model of the navies are evolving around the world. Focusing on how Siemens software enables the current asset status monitoring and the availability prediction required by the Spanish Navy.</p>
					<p>The presentation concludes that the S80 Systems Engineering approach has evolved to support the sustainment of the submarine fleet. Key conclusions include the need for a model-based product support system, to adapt to new Customer requirements regarding the Trough Life Support, the importance of these tools and methodologies, and the necessity of changing the engineering culture from a document-based to a model-based approach. The Siemens Software MBSE and simulation tools have been supporting the transformation process from a document-based Product Development to a Model-Based Product Support. The results of this pilot will directly contribute to Navantia digital transformation goals, mainly:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Adoption of Model Based Engineering. In Shipbuilding Industry, creating and maintaining a Model-Based Product Development has a big return on operation of the Assets.</li>
					<li>Naval Vessels Digital Twins. Navies requirements have changed from preventive maintenance to predictive maintenance and constant asset monitoring and evaluation. MBSE-driven digital twins play a central role.</li>
					<li>Software Integration. The software tools available and the integration between Teamcenter, and Capella (System Modeling Workbench) and Amesim allows a seamless information flow and the collaborative work of Systems Engineers and Simulation Engineers.</p>

					<p>As the MBSE value is now broadly accepted, Rivada Space Networks (RSN) focus shifted from advocacy to effective implementation introducing MBSE directly into the OuterNET program: a complex LEO constellation offering global, secure, low-latency, point-to-point connectivity without relying on terrestrial gateways.</p>
					<p>This world‚Äôs first gateway-less communications network presents unique architecture and engineering challenges in a context requiring a much faster development pace compared to traditional space programs. MBSE at RSN ensures consistency, correctness, and completeness throughout the design and development, while remaining agile and adaptable to highly dynamic environments. This work outlines RSN‚Äôs implementation-first approach to MBSE adoption detailing strategies, workflows, and lessons learned from introducing MBSE into a partially defined architecture which required strategic alignment with existing concepts and rapid development. Key strategies included defining clear scope, retrofitting documents to reflect prior design decisions, and harmonizing engineering workflows. Special attention was placed on aligning MBSE with RSN‚Äôs philosophy relying heavily on procurement and co-engineering with partners: the OuterNET system model is the reference for the system functional design used to specify the expected functional needs against contracts with partners engaged to realize design solution.</p>
					<p>The RSN‚Äôs engineering workflows were tailored for a system-level use case-centric modeling to foster alignment on functional and interfaces aspects transversally across several disciplines by means of shared representations of Functional chains and Exchange Scenarios. Capella, with its Arcadia methodology and extensions like Python4Capella and Property Values, are tailored to enable seamless tool integration, enhance traceability, and facilitate communication between subsystems operating at varying levels of maturity.</p>

					<p>As defined by the INCOSE organization, the "Systems Engineering" practice is a "transdisciplinary and integrative approach to enable the successful realization of engineered systems.". And if Capella could be a vector of interoperability between MBSE and other practices ? This paper shares several features added to Capella during Capgemini projects to highlight MBSE activities with other practices (Project Management, Safety, Product Line Engineering, Frugal Platform).</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Allocation to workpackages : allow the allocation of Capella objects (functions, logical / physical components, ‚Ä¶) to workpackages of the project to manage work sharing into a project or a consortium. [PVMT, DS]</li>
					<li>Dashboard : allow communication about the quality, completeness and health of the MBSE model according to definition of KPIs and dashboard. [Python4Capella]</li>
					<li>Decision management : allow the modelization of a network of decisions linked to any other Capella objects. Support impact analysis on systems engineering data when the project shall modify a decision. [Python4Capella]</li>
					<li>Inputs for safety analysis : allow a structured export of functions from Capella layers into a Functional Breakdown Structure into an Excel file, reused by a safety team to run Preliminary Risk Analysis to identify safety related functions and add new safety requirements. [Python4Capella]</li>
					<li>Product Line Engineering basics : allow the definition of a variability model and the identification of Capella objects that are specific to each variant. Support the reduction of a 150% multi-variants model into a 100% model of a selected variant. [Python4Capella, PVMT, DS, Excel]</li>
					<li>Frugal SE platform : The objective of the frugal SE platform is to embed SE artefacts of a SE referential for a project. The expected efficiency will allow to start to deploy SE/MBSE on a project with limited obstacles caused by the deployment of tools. [Capella, ALM, Python, Excel]</li>

					<h3>Integrating Mission Engineering and Model-Based Systems Engineering: An ARCADIA-Capella Approach</h3>
					<span class="descr">WEDNESDAY 19th of NOVEMBER | 9:05 am UTC+1&nbsp;&nbsp;<button class="tag">Mission Engineering</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">Operational Requirements</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">System-of-systems</button></span>
					<p></p>
					<p>Mission Engineering (ME) is an interdisciplinary process that analyzes, designs, and integrates current and emerging operational needs and capabilities to achieve desired mission outcomes. It focuses on understanding and improving mission performance by assessing systems, technologies, and concepts of operation in an end-to-end context, ensuring that the right systems and capabilities are developed, integrated, and deployed effectively.</p>
					<p>However, ME often faces challenges such as fragmentation and inconsistency across teams and organizations, where varying methods, terminologies, and tools create inefficiencies and hinder collaboration. A persistent gap also exists between systems engineering and mission-level planning, where technical solutions may not align with operational goals, resulting in misaligned capabilities. The inherent complexity of modern missions, with interconnected systems, diverse stakeholders, and dynamic environments, further complicates efforts to analyze dependencies and identify risks or opportunities.</p>
					<p>To address these challenges, this talk presents an effort to align ME activities with Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) using the ARCADIA method and the Capella tool. While Capella is not inherently designed for ME, this work demonstrates how ARCADIA‚Äôs principles can support ME objectives when implemented in Capella. By leveraging these frameworks, the approach bridges the gap between technical systems engineering and mission-level planning, enabling a cohesive and adaptable solution to complex mission challenges.</p>

					<p>The Requirements Engineering and Safety Assurance Network (RESAN) delivers a practical implementation of the ‚Äògolden thread‚Äô‚Äîa concept that ensures end-to-end traceability from safety-critical data objects such as hazards, safety functions, and safety functional requirements, through to design elements including subassemblies and physical assets in the infrastructure domain.</p>
					<p>Central to this approach is the Capella system modelling tool, which acts as the integration hub between requirements, system architecture, and downstream design and asset models. RESAN leverages Capella to establish structured traceability into the Building Information Model (BIM) environment, capturing both the 3D representation and metadata of physical assets. Capella models are also linked to detailed design schematics, providing demonstratable evidence in support of safety related change decisions across the system lifecycle.</p>

					<h3>Rationalization of MBSE modeling in a Product Line Engineering (PLE) with Capella</h3>

					<p></p>
					<p>The increasing complexity and variability of modern systems demand approaches that go beyond traditional MBSE practices. Customers expect highly tailored solutions, while industries must ensure efficiency, reuse, and digital continuity across product lines.</p>
					<p>Feature-based Product Line Engineering (FbPLE), standardized in ISO 26580 and supported by AFIS guidance, provides a structured methodology to manage variability by organizing engineering assets around features. When coupled with Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), this approach evolves into Model-Based Product Line Engineering (MBPLE), enabling end-to-end consistency and traceability.</p>
					<p>MBDA, with the support of LGM, has engaged in a transformation program to rationalize MBSE modeling practices within a PLE environment. Capella, powered by the Arcadia methodology, plays a central role in this effort, ensuring that variability management and architectural modeling are tightly integrated with requirements and testing activities.</p>
					<p>Our industrial feedback highlights three main steps:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Standardization: Adapting ISO 26580 and AFIS principles into MBDA‚Äôs environment through a dedicated PLE guidance.</li>
					<li>Integration: Connecting Capella models and Pure::Variants (variability management).</li>
					<li>Rationalization: Developing cross-domain processes and 150% models in Capella, from which customer-specific 100% configurations can be instantiated.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The deployment demonstrates significant benefits:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Stronger variability management, with consistent feature-driven reuse across projects.</li>
					<li>Enhanced digital continuity, linking requirements, system models, and test cases seamlessly.</li>
					<li>More efficient MBSE practices, as Capella is rationalized into a product line logic rather than isolated product models.</li>
					<li>Increased customer responsiveness, with the ability to derive architectures and configurations more quickly.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This industrial case shows how Arcadia/Capella can be leveraged to achieve digital continuity and manage variability.</p>

					<h3>Integrating Arcadia-Capella MBSE and STPA for Early-Stage Safety Analysis in Railway Systems</h3>
					<span class="descr">WEDNESDAY 19th of NOVEMBER | 4:15 pm UTC+1&nbsp;&nbsp;<button class="tag">Railway</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">STPA</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">Safety Analysis</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">Requirements</button></span>
					<p></p>
					<p>Railway systems face escalating safety challenges due to increasing complexity, software-intensive subsystems, and interdependent operations. Indian Railways reported over 350 fatalities in consequential accidents (2019-2024), highlighting urgent needs for systematic safety frameworks. Traditional methods like FMEA and FTA remain component-focused, missing emergent hazards from human-system interactions, software logic errors, and unsafe operational scenarios.</p>
					<p>This framework integrates Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) with Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) using Arcadia-Capella architecture. STPA models safety as a control problem, identifying unsafe control actions and emergent risks through four steps:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Step 1: Define accidents and hazards within system boundaries</li>
					<li>Step 2: Model control structures using Arcadia's System Analysis (SA) and Logical Architecture (LA) layers</li>
					<li>Step 3: Identify Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) against four hazard conditions‚Äîprovision, omission, incorrect timing, inappropriate duration</li>
					<li>Step 4: Identify loss scenarios through flawed algorithms, incorrect process models, missing feedback, or component failures</li>
					</ul>
					<p>STPA-MBSE integration embeds safety within system architecture, enabling early safety requirement derivation and minimizing costly late-stage rework. Arcadia's structured layers provide architectural backbone while STPA adds qualitative rigor. For critical infrastructure like Indian Railways, this methodology addresses systemic risk management needs. Open-source tool plugins enhance adoption accessibility and scalability.</p>
					<p>This proactive approach embeds safety into architecture itself, establishing future-ready railway safety methodology through early safety requirement derivation, new functions identification, and refined component design.</p>

					<p></p>
					<p>The increasing number of space missions and the prevailing that the ground segment is a "Ready-to-Run System" pose significant challenges in the scheduling of space missions. A key issue stems from the lack of emphasis on ground segment complexities in early mission phases, leading to difficulties in assessing existing solutions, fragmented perspectives on system architectures, and inconsistencies in available information.</p>
					<p>These shortcomings can lead to inefficiencies and constraints in later development stages. To address these challenges, this paper presents the Framework for Development of Space Missions Ground Segment Architectures (F4GSA), which offers a structured approach to improving system architecture design, enhancing interoperability, and streamlining the integration of ground segment components. The F4GSA incorporates Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methodology, underscoring its significance and evolution in the space sector, to provide a holistic perspective on ground segment solutions, meeting the demands of single-mission and multi-mission operations.</p>
					<p>The primary benefit of implementing this framework is showed through a case study of a real space mission ‚Äì the ground segment of the BiomeSat, a Brazilian remote sensing satellite to support planning, monitoring and control of the health of Brazilian forests and particular biomes. The results reinforce taking into account the existing solutions, the necessary adaptations, while maintaining flexibility and dynamism in the construction of the proposed models for the mission development.</p>

					<h3>Closing the Loop Between MBSE and Cybersecurity: A Vulnerability Analysing Viewpoint for Capella</h3>
					<span class="descr">THURSDAY 20th of NOVEMBER | 3:35 pm UTC+1&nbsp;&nbsp;<button class="tag">Cybersecurity Life Cycle</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">SBOM</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">CVE</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">KEV</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">Risk Analysis</button></span>
					<p></p>
					<p>Post-deployment vulnerability management is difficult to integrate into classical V-model lifecycles: threats evolve, dependencies are opaque, and linear processes delay discovery and patching. We propose a Capella extension‚Äîthe Vulnerability Analysing Viewpoint (VAV)‚Äîthat integrates runtime cybersecurity concerns into ARCADIA models to enable continuous, model-centric risk control.</p>
					<p>VAV includes first-class concepts (Vulnerability, Affected Asset, Exploit Path, Risk Assessment, Mitigation, Evidence, Decision) and binds them to Capella elements (functions, components, interfaces, modes, exchange items). It captures external sources (SBOM, CVE/NVD/OSV, KEV, advisories), matches affected items, and overlays the impact on logical, physical, and operational views. It also provides an attack-path overlay that traverses ports and exchanges to show propagation across subsystems, together with a risk matrix that computes likelihood and consequence to prioritize mitigation.</p>
					<p>Applied to an industrial control system, VAV reduced mean time to mitigation, highlighted hidden interdependencies, and avoided late-cycle rework and backlog. The approach simplifies recertification while incorporating iterative feedback from the cybersecurity team (SBOM diffs, HWBOM diffs, threat analysis), turning the architecture into an iterative security lifecycle.</p>
					<p>This contribution proposes: (1) the VAV meta-model and Sirius viewpoint definitions; and (2) best-practice workflows for vulnerability capture, impact analysis, mitigation planning, and evidence closure.</p>

					<p></p>
					<p>The growing complexity of engineered systems requires that knowledge captured in system models be accessible beyond the boundaries of systems engineering. Disciplines such as design, analysis, manufacturing, and sustainment increasingly depend on insights embedded in system models, yet existing methods often make it difficult to leverage this content effectively across domains.</p>
					<p>This paper introduces the concept of a System Engineering Knowledge Partner, an approach developed to make model content consumable, analyzable, and actionable for diverse stakeholders. The approach builds on Capella models, enabling structured extraction and representation of knowledge, AI-assisted reasoning, and tailored delivery of information aligned with the needs of other disciplines and domains.</p>
					<p>A demonstration will illustrate how the Knowledge Partner operates on existing Capella model content, showing how requirements, functional chains, and architectural relationships can be surfaced in ways that support decision-making outside of systems engineering. The paper also shares lessons learned in developing this capability, particularly in relation to the role of semantic richness in Arcadia and how these insights can inform SysML v2 practices.</p>
					<p>Finally, attendees will be invited to explore the Knowledge Partner directly, with guidance provided on how to access and experiment with the capability. The paper concludes with reflections on the potential of AI- and model-driven assistants to extend the impact of systems engineering in the broader digital engineering ecosystem.</p>

					<h3>Leveraging Python4Capella for Architecture Evaluation and Trade-off Analysis</h3>
					<span class="descr">THURSDAY 20th of NOVEMBER | 4:55 pm UTC+1&nbsp;&nbsp;<button class="tag">Trade-off Analysis</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">Pugh Matrix</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">Python4Capella</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">PVMT</button></span>
					<p></p>
					<p>In the early stages of system architecture, Systems Engineers must develop and compare multiple candidate architectures to support informed decision-making. To address this challenge, Baker Hughes‚Äô Systems Engineering team leverages the Capella MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering) tool to model candidate architectures, assign evaluation criteria, and generate a Pugh Matrix (a trade-off tool for comparing solutions based on weighted criteria) for decision-support directly from the model.</p>
					<p>The objective of our work is to provide Systems Engineering practitioners with a fully integrated MBSE environment to support critical processes during both existing and new product development phases, particularly architecture selection. To achieve this, engineers define evaluation groups and set weighted criteria, allowing them to systematically assess candidate architectures modelled in Capella.</p>
					<p>Automation scripts, developed with Python4Capella, enable two key steps: </p>
					<ul><li>the generation of a configuration file (.vpd) for the Properties Values Management (PVMT) add-on to apply property values to architecture elements subject to evaluation,</li>
					<li>and the export of these values into a Pugh Matrix in Excel format. This matrix synthesizes the candidate architectures and their ratings against defined evaluation criteria, thus providing decision-makers with a clear, traceable, and model-based comparison framework.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This approach demonstrates how Capella can be extended beyond traditional architecture modeling to support structured trade-off analysis and decision-making in  complex engineering projects.</p>
