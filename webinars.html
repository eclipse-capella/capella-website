							<p>This webinar presents two projects from the University of Antioquia that apply a Model-Based Systems Engineering approach to space system development with Capella. Together, they illustrate how MBSE can support early design decisions, structure complex architectures and improve confidence in the feasibility of ambitious space missions.</p>
							<p><ul><li><b>MBSE Used for design and development of a PoC for a space simulation Vacuum Chamber</b></li></ul></p>
							<p>This presents the design and development process of a Proof Of Concept (PoC) for a modular vacuum chamber intended to simulate space-like conditions. The project is supported by Orbital Mining Corporation and is aligned with their vision and mission. The project was built under a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach. The Capella tool and the Arcadia methodology were used to clearly structure the operational, functional and physical architectures of the system.</p>
							<p>The vacuum chamber is intended to be versatile and to support space simulations. Throughout the development, requirements were stipulated and modeled, and a preliminary cost estimate was performed to analyze the feasibility of such a design. The result is a robust, flexible and scalable technical model that will serve as a basis for future work.</p>

							<p><ul><li><b>A MBSE Approach to the Development of a Space-Based Observatory for NEO Detection</b></li></ul></p>
							<p>Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are asteroids or comets whose orbits bring them within 1.3 AU of the Sun, sometimes crossing Earth’s path and potentially posing an impact risk. Detecting these objects is not always easy, many are very small to be spotted early, and those coming from the Sun’s direction are almost undetectable to ground-based telescopes. This project addresses that challenge by proposing the conceptual design of a space-based observatory aimed at detecting and tracking NEOs that are hard or impossible to see from Earth.</p>
							<p>This work applies a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach, using Capella to model the operational concept, define requirements, and progressively build the functional, logical, and physical architectures of the observatory. Capella makes it possible to keep all these steps connected and traceable, which helps optimize the design of a complex system like the proposed observatory.</p>

						<h3>Environmental Trade-offs into MBSE: An Application of Ecodesign for Capella for System Architects    </h3>
						<span class="fas fa-caret-down txt_yellow" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</span></a>
						<span class="descr"><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>&nbsp;February 12, 2026 | 5PM CET | <i class="fa fa-user-alt"></i></span> Thibault Montigaud (LGM) | EN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<button class="tag">Lifecycle Assessment</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">Environment</button>&nbsp;<button class="tag">Ecodesign</button>

						<div class="accordion-inner">
							<p></p>
							<p>The growing demand for more environmentally sustainable products imposes new constraints and choices on system architects during the design phase. Traditionally, environmental performance trade-off analyses, such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), are carried out systematically outside of the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) workflow and nearly exclusively by LCA specialists, with no direct connection to system design decisions. As a result, actionable levers that could significantly influence a product’s environmental impact are typically identified too late for meaningful design intervention.</p>
							<p>This presentation addresses this gap by making environmental trade-off analysis natively accessible to architects within their established modeling environment. We introduce the integration of environmental criteria and trade-off functionalities directly into Capella, a leading MBSE tool, via the Ecodesign for Capella add-on, a solution developed and provided by the software editor Obeo.</p>
							<p>As early adopters, we share a practical use case and experience report on the innovative potential and unique market positioning of Ecodesign for Capella.</p>
							<p>The approach has been validated through a realistic use case: a fictitious drone inspection product line, adapted from literature and the publicly available AIDA model from IRT Saint Exupéry. The add-on enabled seamless data integration, streamlined traceability of environmental attributes, and empowered architects to perform design-impactful trade-offs without leaving their MBSE environment.</p>

							<p>As system architecture is central to developing complex systems, making Capella models accessible to all stakeholders is key to keeping every discipline aligned. This is especially true when working on traceability coverage or managing regulatory compliance, where teams need to view, manage and navigate links between model elements, requirements and test cases.</p>
							<p>In this webinar, you will learn how to publish Capella models to a controlled web server, making them easily accessible to your teams, and how to have bidirectional navigable traceability between Capella model elements and Jama Connect® artifacts.</p>
							<p>This integration, provided by Obeo as part of Publication for Capella, replaces error prone manual checks by a smooth toolchain keeping all artifacts synchronized throughout the development lifecycle.</p>
							<p>It also makes it easier for stakeholders to view, interact and navigate across any System Engineer data through web servers no matter were is stored the data: in Capella or in Jama Connect.</p>
							<p>Finally, it enables the systems engineering team to detect issues earlier and reduce defects and rework, by ensuring that all stakeholders can quickly reach the most recent and complete information about system architecture, and related requirement and test case at any time.</p>

							<p>Capella brings significant advantages to transport and infrastructure projects through its use of the ARCADIA framework. This includes structured use of Physical Architecture Nodes, Behavioural Components, and Functional Chains, enabling clear modelling of system behaviour and interfaces. The REC/RPL paradigm supports rapid scaling of models with repeated elements, common in infrastructure and transport systems, while functional and component exchanges naturally reflect logical and physical interface patterns. These features provide a solid foundation for interface documentation, further enhanced by Capella’s document generation capability, which enables efficient, repeatable production of artefacts at scale where many documents need to be produced.</p>

							<p>In this webinar, we will share our journey integrating safety and reliability analyses within the Capella ecosystem through the development and application of ATICA. Designed as an addon to Capella and fully aligned with the ARCADIA methodology, ATICA enables seamless modelling and analysis workflows for engineers conducting Failure Hazard Analyses (FHA), Failure Mode and Effects Analyses (FMEA), and Fault Tree Analyses (FTA).</p><p>We will begin with a brief overview of Anzen Engineering’s digital engineering roadmap and how ATICA emerged from real-world needs in projects like CORSARIO. We will then explore how the ATICA methodology builds upon ARCADIA to embed RAMS tasks directly within the system model, using a dedicated safety metamodel and intuitive analysis viewpoints.</p><p>Through live examples, we will walk through the execution of FHA, FMEA, and FTA within Capella, demonstrating how changes in one analysis propagate across others — ensuring model-wide consistency. This end-to-end traceability enhances efficiency and reduces manual, error-prone efforts.</p><p>We will also introduce upcoming developments, including ATICA’s evolution towards SysML v2 and integration with additional tools — broadening its compatibility across MBSE ecosystems.</p><p>Whether you are a Capella user seeking to enhance your safety processes, or a safety engineer exploring model-based approaches, this webinar will offer actionable insights and practical takeaways.</p>

But what if it did not have to be this way?</p><p>At GU Orbit, we have adopted the Arcadia method exactly to make the process of engineering complex space systems more accessible to undergraduate students. With its multi-level workflow, repetitive activities, and opinionated semantics enforced by the Capella tool, it effectively guides even inexperienced users in the design of rational systems. Additionally, taking advantage of its semantic similarity to the European Space Agency's TASTE toolchain for embedded software development, we have devised an overarching methodology to rigorously bridge the gap between high-level system specifications and low-level component code.</p><p>This Arcadia-based method comprises the entire systems engineering lifecycle in a unified V-shaped model. The design phase is performed in Capella, regularly traversing all main functional decomposition levels. Specific physical-level views are then used to translate the resulting model into TASTE, trivialising the implementation phase down to individual lines of code in the Specification and Description Language (SDL, ITU-T Z.100) and C/C++. Finally, the verification and validation phases are carried out at all levels of abstraction by comparing specific TASTE-generated diagrams, such as State Chart Views and Message Sequence Charts (MSC, ITU-T Z.120), against their Capella-defined counterparts.</p><p>In this webinar, we will illustrate this method in the context of GU Orbit's student-led development of autonomous nanosatellite avionics, which were successfully demonstrated during an early stratospheric balloon flight.</p><p></p><p><i></i></p><p><i><i><span class="txt_indigo">Giorgio Ciacchella</span> is Project Manager and Systems Engineer at GU Orbit.

The need to describe external contracts, regulations, or non-functional requirements, for instance, can be more efficiently satisfied by using textual specifications. In order to achieve the desired <i>Common Source of Truth</i>, model and textual requirements must be connected and coexist, desirable enhanced by the automatization of the consistency checking, automatically modifying one side when changes are produced on the other end...</p><p>Within The REUSE Company, we have realised how crucial it is to facilitate this connection and provide Systems Engineers with the tools required for applying SE across the entire process as seamlessly as possible.
