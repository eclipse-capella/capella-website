					<h3>Accelerating Railway Digitization: Scaling Up MBSE in a High-Paced Organization</h3>
					<p>At <a href="https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/en">Digital Rail for Germany</a>, a railway sector initiative, we work on digitalization and application of latest technologies to bring more capacity to the existing network, increase quality and punctuality. To manage the complexity of the challenge at hand we adopted a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach and created an own engineering environment around Capella.</p>
					<p>We use Capella for both internal development projects and together with our partners within Europe Rail Joint Undertaking. Due to the complexity of our environment Capella alone was not enough so we developed an engineering environment around Capella and integrated it with the rest of our engineering toolchain. Most of the bespoke development we've done is public on <a href="https://github.com/DSD-DBS.">GitHub</a>.</p>
					<p>However, scaling MBSE up across a large organization presents unique challenges. These include enabling collaboration on models across different organizations, making MBSE content accessible to non-MBSE stakeholders, and addressing the need for efficient training. Our presentation outlines our strategies to overcome these challenges:</p>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Capella Collaboration Manager</b>: An environment designed to reduce the entry barriers for MBSE. We'll demonstrate how users can quickly get into Capella and related tools without installing anything locally, automate tasks, and collaborate in real-time by sharing sessions with other users.</li>
					<li><b>Model Accessibility for Non-MBSE Stakeholders</b>: We will showcase how to make MBSE content more accessible for a broader audience: communicating and reviewing model-derived deliverables, discussing content through comment threads, producing evidence of review, and tracking model changes.</li>
					<li><b>Scalable Training Solutions</b>: As we prepare to launch multiple projects simultaneously, the need to onboard and train a large number of project engineers is critical. We will present our self-led, on-demand training solution that offers hands-on experience.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This talk will provide valuable insights into how we address these challenges, ensuring that MBSE can be scaled effectively to support the digital transformation of Germany's railway system.</p>

					<h3>Adoption of ARCADIA and Capella to Develop an Elimination Process of Radioactive Waste by Melting</h3>
					<p>The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) has operated high-energy accelerators for 70 years of research in fundamental physics. CERN’s scientific activities currently produce up to 640 tons of radioactive waste (RW) per year, which are generated by the interaction between high energy particles and equipment present inside the accelerator complex. CERN reuses activated material as far as possible, the rest that cannot be reused or recycled is eliminated in dedicated disposal facilities for radioactive waste of the two Host States, France and Switzerland.</p>
					<p>The ARCADIA methodology and the Capella tool were used for the first time by the CERN Radiation Protection Group to conceive and specify an effective process for the elimination by melting of metallic radioactive waste. A project was launched accordingly in 2019, whose aim was to prove the feasibility of the new process, termed “MAST” (Melting of Activated STeel). As a result, a batch of 19 m3 of Low-Level/Intermediate-Level metallic radioactive waste was successfully selected, characterized and then melted at the end of 2022, resulting in 8.3 ingots (1.9 m3) and 0.15 m3 of slag that were successfully disposed of in June 2023.</p>
					<p>This talk provides an overview of how the ARCADIA methodology guided in the development of a complex RW industrial process as MAST by means of graphical elements alone. The Capella software was instrumental, providing a rich set of diagrams that covered all the design needs; it generated automatically a textual specification of the process that was required by the auditing French Authorities but that was actually never used throughout the development, implementation, and audit: the diagrams conveyed all information needed and served as a clear basis for its understanding when discussing with the development and auditing teams. Differences in the educational backgrounds of technicians, engineers or physicists played little or no role at all.</p>
