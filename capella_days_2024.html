					<ul>
					<li>how Capella is used across the projects (modeling objectives, model re-use challenges),</li>
					<li>what challenges we face while spreading it around the organization (acceptance by wider non-SE audience, challenges related to partnerships with suppliers, pressure from SysML and MBPLE / FBPLE crowd),
					<li>our integrated open source toolchain and extensions that help us making Capella useful for a wider audience at DB (collab manger, training mode, session sharing, model explorer, etc),</li>
					<li>modeling for deliverables (work instructions and report templates to get deliverables out of the door, Polarion integration).

					<h3>Adoption of ARCADIA and Capella to Develop an Elimination Process of Radioactive Waste by Melting</h3>
					<p>The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) has operated high-energy accelerators for 70 years of research in fundamental physics. CERN’s scientific activities currently produce up to 640 tons of radioactive waste (RW) per year, which are generated by the interaction between high energy particles and equipment present inside the accelerator complex. CERN reuses activated material as far as possible, the rest that cannot be reused or recycled is eliminated in dedicated disposal facilities for radioactive waste of the two Host States, France and Switzerland.</p>
					<p>The ARCADIA methodology and the Capella tool were used for the first time by the CERN Radiation Protection Group to conceive and specify an effective process for the elimination by melting of metallic radioactive waste. A project was launched accordingly in 2019, whose aim was to prove the feasibility of the new process, termed “MAST” (Melting of Activated STeel). As a result, a batch of 19 m3 of Low-Level/Intermediate-Level metallic radioactive waste was successfully selected, characterized and then melted at the end of 2022, resulting in 8.3 ingots (1.9 m3) and 0.15 m3 of slag that were successfully disposed of in June 2023.</p>
					<p>This talk provides an overview of how the ARCADIA methodology guided in the development of a complex RW industrial process as MAST by means of graphical elements alone. The Capella software was instrumental, providing a rich set of diagrams that covered all the design needs; it generated automatically a textual specification of the process that was required by the auditing French Authorities but that was actually never used throughout the development, implementation, and audit: the diagrams conveyed all information needed and served as a clear basis for its understanding when discussing with the development and auditing teams. Differences in the educational backgrounds of technicians, engineers or physicists played little or no role at all.</p>
