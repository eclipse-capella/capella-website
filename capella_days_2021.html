				<h3>How I pack my suitcase</h3>
				<p>MONDAY 15th of NOVEMBER | 3:35 pm CET</p>
				<p>Model-based systems engineering is everywhere - everyone talks about it, everyone wants to use it, but what is actually behind it? This question will be outlined by means of a playful approach and a real problem: "I pack my suitcase and take with me...".</p>
				<p>Based on this problem, we will successively use the game to pack the suitcase with the help of SE and finally MBSE and present it by means of a small demonstration. Let's go together on the hopefully soon journey and pack our suitcase.</p>

					<h3>Warmup - Introduction to CAPELLA/ARCADIA and NASA Systems Engineering Handbook: Modeling overview with the HUBBLE Space Telescope</h3>
					<p>MONDAY 15th of NOVEMBER | 4:05 pm CET</p>
					<p>The NASA System Engineering (SE) handbook aims to provide general guidance and information on systems engineering, as it should be applied throughout NASA. The handbook introduces 3 common technical processes. One of these, is the System Design Process, describing the stakeholders expectations, requirements definition, logical decomposition and design solution definition. The 4 activities can be supported by a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach. To do so, an appropriate method and tool is necessary as the one provided by the ARChitecture Analysis & Design Integrated Approach.</p>
					<p>ARCADIA, with its modeler CAPELLA, is a MBSE solution supporting system modeling activities. Based on 4 architectural layers, which are Operational Analysis, System Analysis, Logical and Physical Architecture, it is a structured architecture engineering method for defining and validating multi-domain systems.
					<br>This talk will present an educational overview of the ARCADIA methodology and System Design Process from the NASA SE, by introducing MBSE artefacts for space system.
					<p>The HUBBLE Space Telescope (HST) is a Cassegrain reflector telescope. Orbiting above the earth, HST elaborates a clear view of the universe free from the blurring and absorbing effects of the atmosphere. In order to illustrate the journey throughout CAPELLA, the HST will be introduced, as example, based on public information available.</p>

				<h3>The long way from Bid to project... supported by Capella</h3>
				<p>TUESDAY 16th of NOVEMBER | 4:05 pm CET</p>
				<p>In 2018 during the Capella Days I showed how Capella and ARCADIA could be successfully applied supporting the bid phase of a large railway signalling project. In the meantime, this bid-project has changed into a real-world project.</p>
				<p>This presentation shows the long way from the bid model to the project model in Capella. Beside looking at some questions like "What can be reused form the bid model?" or "How can we quickly enlarge the number of system architects working on the project?", we will have a look at some of the pitfalls on this way.</p>
				<p>Additionally this talk gives some answers to questions like "Which of the different views of ARCADIA are suitable for which purpose?" or "How can one model special topics like communication with customers, description of external interfaces or safety and security aspects for a large railway traffic management system".</p>

				<h3>A STEP towards Model-based: Case Study covering Conceptual Design of a Fusion Power Plant</h3>
				<p>TUESDAY 16th of NOVEMBER | 4:45 pm CET</p>
				<p>STEP (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production) is a Â£220M project aiming to develop a conceptual design for a First of a Kind (FOAK) commercially viable Fusion Power Plant by 2024.</p>
				<p>Designing a power plant at this scale comes with immense challenges: Systems engineering approach is relatively new to the industry, where the industry has been heavily research based and engineering processes are not fully in place. UKAEA, the organisation running the STEP project, is applying Model-Based Systems Engineering using the Capella tool. </p>
				<p>The focus of our approach in managing the complexity of the system is to perform system analysis and logical architecture analysis, to generate engineering artefacts from the model. Through NGO (Needs, Goals, Objectives) analysis key system capabilities were realised to functional chains, which forms the basis for further refinement of the Logical Architecture. The differentiation between logical and physical architectures has ensured that the design stays at the logical space and the team focuses on defining the problem space. This approach has improved interface management process, by creating model-based interface documents, using the model as âsingle source of truthâ to achieve consistency. The architecture definition activities allowed early formalisation of the textual requirements, to drive detailed engineering design in the next phase. </p>
				<p>Adopting Capella comes with challenges - one of which stems from the unique characteristic of the concept phase â the need to generate architectural variants and evaluating them. The framework and the language are limited in performing variant modelling, a topic UKAEA plans to investigate further. Another challenge was that middle-out approach was favoured for STEP whereas Arcadia method prefers the top-down approach. </p>
				<p>Throughout this journey, adopting Capella with its use-friendly interfaces has allowed us to better engage with the programme in the MBSE approach and indoctrinate better SE practices.</p>

				<h3>Using MBSE to Integrate Engineering Undergraduate Courses Curriculum</h3>
 				<p>TUESDAY 16th of NOVEMBER | 5:25 pm CET</p>
				<p>The use of MBSE into the undergraduate courses brings the opportunity to integrate the curriculum through an Integrated Design Model. This lecture will: (i) explain the incorporation of Capella into an Airspace Engineering Curriculum; (ii) describe the experience in each discipline, allowing to keep the context, expanding through systemic perspectives; and (iii) present some results, feedbacks and lessons learned.</p>
				<p>The lecture will close with how the Brazilian Secretary of Education changed the Brazilian Engineering Courses Guidelines to incorporate Systems Thinking and the opportunity to use Arcadia, and Capella â being free/opensource â as a common Systems Engineering Core.</p>

				<h3>Exploring the various roles of MBSE in the digital thread</h3>
				<p>WEDNESDAY 17th of NOVEMBER | 4:05 pm CET</p>
				<p>It is generally agreed that model-based systems engineering plays an important part in the digital thread.</p>
				<p>Despite the general agreement on its importance, the role itself remains poorly defined. At the very least, systems engineering organizes and integrates the work of the various engineering disciplines and groups. Slightly more ambitiously, MBSE can translate system requirements into system elements. Ideally though, the system model, as the output of the MBSE process, should directly participate in the digital thread, as the link between the system requirements and the bill-of-material.</p>
				<p>This presentation will show how the more idealised role (as a participant in the digital thread) can now be realized and explore some of the benefits and costs associated to such an approach.</p>

				<h3>Enhancing CubeSat design through ARCADIA and Capella: a concrete application</h3>
				<p>WEDNESDAY 17th of NOVEMBER | 4:45 pm CET</p>
				<p>The new space economy asks for an overall improvement of systems engineering practices due to aggressive development time and complex systems design, implementation and operation by a number of players who grow with mission complexity. The talk proposes a critical analysis of a Model-Based Systems Engineering approach using ARCADIA and the Capella tool, applied to real CubeSat mission, with the aim of showing potentials and lacks. </p>
				<p>Firstly, the way requirements are managed and traced using the Requirements Viewpoint is presented, highlighting the necessity of having a dedicated diagram for the trees generation; a solution to that is proposed in order to easily trace backwards requirements whenever needed. Following the ARCADIA method, the approach begins with the high-level objectives definition through the Operational Analysis, moving to a first internal functional analysis exploiting the second level of Capella, the System Analysis. The Logical Architecture is then developed introducing the concept of subsystem, leading to big decisions which will drive the successive Physical Architecture. The latter opens the road to all CubeSat components modeling using the concept of Node Physical Component, together with physical interfaces definition. Great use of all Capella concepts is done, such as Functional Chains, Control Functions, Replicas, Basic Mass and Price Viewpoints etc.</p>
				<p>As the approach has been applied to a real space project, Phases and Modes have also been modeled exploiting respectively Scenario Diagrams, also used to define mission Concept of Operations, and State Machine Diagrams. Some thoughts oriented toward an improvement of the Modes management will be discussed. Lastly, ARCADIA and Capella do not provide a proper way of dealing with Assembly, Integration, Verification and Testing activities within the same architectural model, therefore an innovative approach is proposed and discussed to include such aspects in the model.</p>

				<h3>Where to Start with MBSE when Thousands of System Requirements Are Already Defined</h3>
 				<p>WEDNESDAY 17th of NOVEMBER | 5:25 pm CET</p>
				<p>Context: The Thales OneSKY Australia Program is delivering a new Australia-wide integrated Civil and Military Air Traffic Management System, known as CMATS. CMATS replaces the current civilian Air Traffic Management (ATM) system and Defence ATM system, delivering the most advanced and integrated ATM system in the world. It will manage more than 11% of the earthâs airspace and will deliver Air Traffic Services to some of the worldâs busiest air routes.</p>
				<p>Scope: Over the last 4 years of the Design phases of the program, the System-of-Systems Architecture team has defined and deployed a new way of working by focussing on capturing the system-of-systems architecture using state-of-the-art modelling techniques.
				<br>A plan was put in place where the team collectively defined a target set of modelling goals in order to grow the teamâs competency. Part of this plan was a roadmap for the longer term which focused on extending the current approach to further increase the business value of the architecture modelling activities.</p>
				<p>This approach has resulted in a stable working environment that not only allows the management of consistency and complexity, but also enables the team to collaboratively and efficiently work on the architecture definition, which has been critical during the recent working from home period and hectic project phases.</p>
				<p>The key Capella solutions that are used within this activity are the Team for Capella solution, application of the Requirements Viewpoint and the Property Value Management Tool. </p>
				<p>One of the important aspects of the modelling plan is to ensure information within the model can be used by the wider organisation, this is achieved through a Thales specific documentation generation solution and a bespoke csv export capability that allows to export data from the information captured in the architecture model.</p>
				<p>This talk will cover the modelling goals for this activity; where the team is standing today; the best practices and lessons learned.</p>

				<h3>An example of model-centric engineering environment with Capella and CI/CD</h3>
				<p>THURSDAY 18th of NOVEMBER | 4:05 pm CET</p>
				<p>Today a number of  EU railway operators are on a journey to define what the future of railway operations should look like. In Germany, DB AG works within the sector initiative Digitale Schiene Deutschland. Next to the implementation of ETCS/DSTW technology in the first stage, the initiatives aims in the second stage to improve the performance, quality and efficiency of the railway system by higher degrees of automation in traffic management, train driving and infrastructure operation. This requires implementation of new technologies like artificial intelligence, localization and perception sensors, cloud computing and 5G connectivity.</p>
				<p>The challenge is pretty serious - to modernize and digitalize something as complex we need a solid understanding of the railway system itself, the surrounding actors, the operational processes / workflows, functions and responsibilities. And then we need a way to design automation concepts and test those against  the operational needs - we call it The Reference Architecture. An analysis of that scale requires knowledge and expertise across multiple domains and involves a pretty large number of stakeholders. We found ARCADIA method to be just the right thing and as Capella is freely available we could easily test how it fits.</p>
				<p>The reference architecture is being developed in according to a detailed process that elaborates on the basic steps of ARCADIA to give specific guidelines on every step of engineering. The process is broadly structured in the layers of ARCADIA, then influenced by the safety and RAM standard EN 50126, the systems engineering standard ISO 15288 and the specific situation we found ourselves in. The process is described according to architecture framework standard ISO 42010 with an emphasis on precise definition of the contents of each modelling artefact. Early results of the deployment of this detailed process have been positive, with reductions in the complexity of the model, and clearer, more precise and more consistent functions being identified against a reusable pattern.</p>
				<p>To validate the design decisions and assumptions that we made in the Reference Architecture, when a simulation is insufficient, we do prototype projects. The Sensors4Rail prototype project was designed in Capella nearly from the start. And for a number of common engineering reasons it was designed bottom up. It is an example of a classical project madness with disruptive changes, priority shifts and very high level of uncertainty. And thanks to flexibility of Capella and ARCADIA we got through it with the model being the place where most of the engineering decisions took place - be it functional, software or hardware engineering.</p>
				<p>As the adoption went on we saw a need for deriving documents and engineering artifacts from the model and sharing those with various internal and external stakeholders. We tried to do that by hand first but as it was time consuming we went through a project to automate workflows around Capella. Today we operate a number of CI/CD pipelines that deliver documents, engineering artifact and Confluence page updates on every commit. We have a framework that enables us to derive engineering artifacts from the model quickly, traverse it in all possible directions and render in any shape and form (IDL, pdf, xlsx). For those projects that use TeamForCapella we operate a self-service web-based management environment.</p>
				<p>In this presentation youâll have a guided tour through the MBSE Toolchain we made around Capella, Gitlab, Confluence, Jira and TeamForCapella and get a feeling for what automation one could get by mixing open-source with nice (open API) commercial and simple bespoke tools.</p>

				<h3>How much time does modeling take? Experiences from modeling without experience</h3>
				<p>THURSDAY 18th of NOVEMBER | 5:25 pm CET</p>
				<p>A shared common mental model of a system design between team members is a goal many projects aspire to. Applying MBSE can be one way of achieving this. Here we present the results of an inexperienced modeler taking existing code logic and modeling it in Capella 5.0, and measuring how much effort was needed. The models make the logic of the program more accessible to coders who did not worked on that specific piece of code previously, which can increase the possibility of code review and improving logic. The case study was a University CubeSat team, where team members join the project as a part of their thesis, while the project continues for 2-3 years, and modeling the code logic can reduce some of the onboarding effort required when new members want to reuse or improve on existing codebase.</p>
