				<h3>What is Capella?</h3>
				<p>Capella is an open-source and field-proven Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) solution to
					successfully design systems architecture.</p>
				<p>It provides systems, software and hardware architects with rich methodological guidance relying on
					Arcadia, a comprehensive model-based engineering method based on both industrial experimentations
					and system engineers' feedback</p>
				<p>Natively supporting Arcadia , Capella can be customized to fit the specific needs of many industrial
					domains.</p>

<p>Is Capella just another modeling solution?</p>

<p>After all, you also draw boxes and arrows. After all, you also model structure, data, interfaces, behavior. After all, you also have to define your own modeling guidelines and objectives.</p>

<p>So, what makes Capella different from the other modeling solutions out there?</p>

<p>What is the scope of Capella and its corresponding methodology Arcadia? How can you benefit from nearly 10 years of MBSE return on experiment? Why is open source a game changer? How can you contribute to shape the future of your own engineering environment?</p>

				<p>Capella and the underlying method ARCADIA are well known as system architecture tools used in the development phase of systems. But the preceding bid phase often require a creation of a rough system architecture, for example for the coordination of the interfaces to neighbouring systems.</p>
				<p>This presentation shows how the different layers of ARCADIA and the corresponding implementation in Capella could be used to solve several problems occurring in the bid phase. Additional it illustrates the challenges resulting from the broad variability of solution in the railway signalling business.</p>

				<h3 id="Managing_your_Capella_assets_with_Yuzu">Managing your Capella assets with Yuzu</h3>
				<p>To support reuse strategies, Capella provides the powerful mechanism of REC/REP that, along with libraries, allows to organize reusable building blocks. To go further, the latest version of Capella embeds a new modeling accelerator that drastically ease the creation process of a REC library. With these exciting features, no doubt that the number of libraries will keep increasing. And when you mix this with version management, the combinations rapidly explode. In all your production, how to find the right library?

</p>
				<p>Yuzu is an asset management solution - based on the OMG RAS standard - that will allow you to keep track of all the Capella projects and libraries. In addition to the business meta-information filled by the author, Yuzu automatically extracts additional data, metrics and dependencies from the Capella model and then publish the packaged model in a repository. Later, the powerful query engine allows you to search for a specific model, based on any meta-information or model content and download it along with all its dependencies. Never lose track of your Capella models again!</p>

				<p>Compared to single product development, developing and maintaining a portfolio of related products comes with additional challenges. A systematic approach is needed to realize a high reuse rate that minimizes the maintenance effort and maximizes the productivity.


</p><p>Prof. Dr. Danilo Beuche will present how these challenges can be tackled for all assets of the development lifecycle using pure::variants, focusing on its integration with Capella.

				<h3 id="The_Capella_Industrial_Consortium">The Capella Industrial Consortium

</h3>
				<p>In the last few decades, companies have developed business models around open source providing services, extensions, courses and so on: Business friendly ecosystems around open source technologies like Linux, Eclipse, Apache have developed. In the late 2000's, the Eclipse Foundation started to replicate the best practices that made the success of the Eclipse platform to new domains, and to integrate industry players that were seen as software consumers at the core of these new ecosystems. The main driver for these new form of consortia was to use open source as a framework for open collaboration and open innovation.</p>
				<p>The presentation will briefly discuss the challenges that industries are facing (cross-company, cross-domain, long-term availability, open innovation). After that, we will present the Capella Industry Consortium (IC) that has been created as a new Eclipse Working Group to develop the Capella ecosystem with vendor-neutral and open governance. It aims at fostering collaborations, sharing investment and best practices and leveraging Open Innovation to co-develop new MBSE capabilities. The scope of this Working Group focuses on the Capella tool, the add-ons and the underlying technologies.
