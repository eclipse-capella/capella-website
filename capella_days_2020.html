						<p>MONDAY 12th of OCTOBER | 4:05 pm CET</p>
						<p>Complex systems engineering programs not only deal with the inherent complexity of the systems they develop, but also shall be able to adapt very quickly to changes.</p>
						<p>This requires adapting existing well-proven engineering practices in order to support shorter time-to-markets, more frequent variations in operational contexts and usages,
						and more complex engineering organizations. In this talk, Juan Navas will present the latest methodological progress on Arcadia and Capella that tackle these stakes.</p>

						<p>Sustained innovation is a goal of many development organizations. Sustaining innovation is depicted on an Innovation as matrix as the result of well-defined problem,
						and a well-defined domain definition. An example will be presented how an MBSE tool, based on open source tool Capella, can enhance both the problem definition and domain

						<h3 id="talk_cnes">Successful Capella landing on a CNES operational use case</h3>
						<p>MONDAY 12th of OCTOBER | 5:25 pm CET</p>
						<p>The Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is a space system dedicated to gamma ray detection and study, under development by China National Space Administration (CNSA)
						and the French Space Agency (CNES), to be launched in 2021. The system shall be able to trigger alerts of Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) in real-time with a maximum of associated data.
						It is composed of a space segment (a set of various sensors embedded on a satellite) associated to a worldwide antenna ground network, all managed by the two agencies.</p>
						<p>The design of this system was conducted within the framework of the CNES engineering process, based on a set of documents cascading the textual requirements from
						the high-level concept of operations to the technical specification of equipment. The validation of the obtained specification mainly relies on human expertise and on the
						validation campaign. The complexity of the system made it a perfect candidate for an experimentation of MBSE using Capella.
						Two projects took place successively in this context: a first one was an R&T study, dedicated to the analysis of the current process and the evaluation of the potential
						benefits that MBSE could bring (restricted to some part of the system but spread on several engineering layers (architecture, simulation, satellite database definition...)).
						Due to promising results, a second project, based on the models realized during the first study, was dedicated to the operational capture of the system validation.</p>
    					<p>The smooth incursion of Capella in CNES engineering process was undeniably well received. The SVOM experts were converted to this new way of working.
    					The building of an operational model-based toolchain to capture the system architecture and its associated V&V specification is an achievement which opens the door to a wider
    					reach of MBSE within CNES. </p>

						<p>TUESDAY 13th of OCTOBER | 4:05 pm CET</p>
						<p>MBSE is by now widely adopted in the Aerospace and Defense industry. These industries however typically develop their systems with very large, one-of-a-kind system projects,
						following the V model. A large upfront (MB)SE effort is justified then as the cost of late failures are extremely high. </p>
						<p>The High-Tech Equipment Industry on the other hand develops their systems incrementally with an agile Systems Engineering process,
						supporting many product variants and often a configure-to-order sales process.</p>
						<p>How does MBSE match up with the characteristics of the High-Tech Equipment Industry? ESI and its partners have started a collaborative project to study together whether,
						and if so how, MBSE, or MBSE elements, can improve Systems Engineering in this industry business context.</p>
						This talk will provide an update on the state of SE in the High-Tech Equipment Industry, its use of models, and the outlook on the fit of MBSE in this industry context.</p>

						<p>TUESDAY 13th of OCTOBER | 5:25 pm CET</p>
						<p>More than 8 million tons of plastic are dumped in the oceans every year. If we don’t take action, in 2050, there will be more plastic than fishes in the oceans!</p>
						<p>The SeaCleaners association has been founded to provide global, long-term and worldwide solutions for fighting against ocean plastic pollution.
						The flagship project initiated by The SeaCleaners is the MANTA, the first seagoing vessel capable of collecting and processing in continuous flow large quantities
						of macro plastic waste floating at the surface of oceans.Its design has been focusing on many innovative technologies
						in the field of renewable energy production or by limiting her global carbon footprint maximizing the energy self-sufficiency.</p>
						<p>In this talk we will present a Capella extension developped by Obeo in partnership with The SeaCleaners and Altran to facilitate the Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA)
						of complex systems. This extension consists of additional concepts added to Capella for inventorying components' physical characteristics and the substances
						they consume and/or emit. This information attached to the system architecture can be automatically exported as an initial inventory analysis to LCA tools
						used by environmental experts to perform their impact analysis (such as SimaPro and OpenLCA).</p>
						<p>Experimented on a MANTA subsystem, we will show how this integration between Capella and LCA Tools accelerates the evaluation of the impacts a
						system has on its environment, and helps system designers to make architecture decisions that are better for the planet.</p>

						<p>WEDNESDAY 14th of OCTOBER | 4:05 pm CET</p>
						<p>The deployment of Model-Based System Engineering in space projects is not straightforward. The interactions among stakeholders at various levels happen to
						be difficult because the various tools involved are not fully interoperable. </p>
						<p>One of the key elements that would facilitate and ensure the exchange of engineering data information, is the definition of a System Engineering supporting infrastructure,
						also called System Factory, that would allow implementing this interoperability.</p>
						<p>This presentation introduces the approach that is being followed to define the functional architecture of this System Factory which follows the Arcadia method and uses the Capella tool.</p>

						<p>WEDNESDAY 14th of OCTOBER | 4:45 pm CET</p>
						<p>In this talk, Harish will share his experiences on a project where he had to develop system requirement specifications
						for an Automatic Train Operation -Trackside (ATO-TS) system, one of the key components that helps with Automatic Train Operations.</p>
						<p>He will present his personal experiences with Capella, as a new user, and will explain the different focus points where NEXTRAIL
						applies Capella including systems modelling and data modelling (for Interfaces).</p>
						<p>You will discover the project specific analysis with Capella and will get answers of the following questions:
						<ul>
						<li>How Capella was related to the scope of the project? Including basic understandings of the systems.</li>
	   					<li>How it helped NEXTRAIL achieve targets of the projects?</li>
	   					<li>What were their modelling practices? Ease of modelling, workflow using a meta model, MBSE activities, integration with teams, beneficial aspects of Capella... </li>
	   					<li>What were the problems NEXTRAIL faced while modelling? </li>
