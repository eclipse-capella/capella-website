The processes that he has been able to deploy and practice on different programs are centered on a Capella model, taking particular care to link this model to other engineering data (textual requirements, tests, etc.) in order to ensure consistency and mastery of the whole. Coming from the software world, he also attaches great importance to the system to software transition (generation of interface and/or architecture code, generation of specifications, incrementality of the process, etc.).</i>

				<h3>A method for quantitative evaluation of functional chains supported by a Capella add-on</h3>
				<p>TUESDAY 15th of NOVEMBER | 4:25 pm CET</p>
				<p>Development of high-tech systems is a complex task done by diverse specialists distributed across the globe. Reference architectures including a clear functional breakdowns can support them and support their decisions. This presentation proposes an approach to improve the development of advanced electron microscopes by using Capella as an authoritative source of information. To support design decisions, a Capella AddOn has been developed to obtain quantitative information, such as throughput numbers, for a particular workflow.
First, we will illustrate how functional and system decompositions can be captured and serve as company-wide architecting assets to inform design decisions. Next, we will outline how simulating Capella models can bring valuable insights to modelers.  During a demo, we’ll simulate Capella’s Functional chains using the open-source simulation tool POOSL (https://github.com/eclipse/poosl) , and visualize results using the freely available TRACE4CPS tool (https://www.eclipse.org/trace4cps/). Re-using functions from the reference architecture allows us reason about design aspects such as the relation between throughput and design choices about function allocation and parallelism.</p>

				<h3>Expand MBSE into Model-based Production Engineering (MBPE) to realize a Lego Manufacturing System</h3>
				<p>TUESDAY 15th of NOVEMBER | 5:15 pm CET</p>
				<p>Mind Game: You want to build a LEGO Mindstorms Factory for Toy Cars and you are Head of Factory Planning. You identify that your manufacturing planning team and your product design team don’t collaborate with each other, because they work in silos and speak different languages. Their progress is too slow and the results are not synchronized.</p><p>Imagine: You succeed in merging your experts into one interdisciplinary team where everyone is collaboratively working together – already in the early stages of the engineering cycle. And imagine they start to speak the same language. Doubtless, you would speed up your engineering process. Furthermore, you would also reach a synchronized global solution for your manufacturing system and to be produced toy cars, building bridges inside your organization.</p><p>But how? This has been introduced by Dr.-Ing. C. Sinnwell in February 2020 in her PhD-thesis. There, she published the latest version of a methodology referred to as “MBPE – Model-Based Production Engineering”. The MBPE-methodology is a new approach for the conceptual design of manufacturing systems based on early product information supported by MBSE using UML.</p><p>The presentation will spotlight the MBPE-methodology, explaining how to use MBSE in the context of interdisciplinary factory and manufacturing planning. Also, it will be shown, how the methodology could be adapted to be realized with Eclipse Capella instead of any UML-modeling tool, illustrated by an example on how to conceptualize and model a LEGO Mindstorms production line for Toy Cars.</p>

				<h3>Stairway to heaven: Climbing the very first steps</h3>
				<p>WEDNESDAY 16th of NOVEMBER | 4:25 pm CET</p>
				<p>We MBSE enthusiasts love to imagine or witness sophisticated model-based engineering practices. We dream or in the best cases take advantage of digital continuity, automation, large-scale consistency, integration of disciplines, and end-to-end impact analyses.</p><p>However not all of our architect and engineer fellows are in a situation in which they can appreciate sophistication of engineering practices the same way as we do. Entangled in everyday problems and facing the pressure to deliver, they perceive the introduction of model-based practices as an additional risk for a benefit that too often appears intangible.</p><p>Reaching the top of the stairs requires climbing the very first steps. This talk focuses on one of the most challenging aspects of MBSE deployment: lowering the height of the first steps. Paired with a pragmatic and incremental change management strategy, Capella and its add-ons are precious helpers.</p>

				<p>In the last three years CILAS has been tailoring and applying the Arcadia methodology to several international projects related to complex optronics products development. Even though the implementation is not yet thorough and systemic within the company, CILAS is already reaping benefits of this approach on several fronts (e.g. communication, identification of optimization opportunities, knowledge capitalization etc). All in all Arcadia is a powerful methodology that significantly helps CILAS reinforcing its core skills and meeting its objectives in very challenging sectors.</p>

				<h3>Interface Control Document Generation and Linkage to PLM EBOM</h3>
				<p>THURSDAY 17th of NOVEMBER | 3:35 pm CET</p>
				<p>Generation of Interface Control Documents (ICDs) using a model-based method has a number of advantages over text-based approaches.  This paper describes the Python-based software that was written to automatically generate different versions of an ICD from a structure model in Capella.  One use case for this approach is checking parts changes captured in the Engineering Bill of Materials (EBOM) using a PLM tool.  We demonstrate an automated workflow that links changes in the EBOM to a request to vet the change against the ICD.  This presentation will discuss our rationale, approach, results, and lessons learned.</p>

				<h3>Closing the gap between traditional engineering and digital-native engineering at Naval Group</h3>
				<p>THURSDAY 17th of NOVEMBER | 4:25 pm CET</p>
				<p>Closing the gap between traditional engineering and digital-native model-based driven engineering requires helping engineers to embrace new techniques. Naval Group decided to tackle the following issues: lack of interoperability with other systems, lack of bridge between functional definitions in PID schemas and MBSE physical layers, lack of documenting cross-layers relationships for a specific object's type.</p>

				<h3>Interplanetary Space Mission as a reverse-engineering background for the Capella environment</h3>
				<p>THURSDAY 17th of NOVEMBER | 5:15 pm CET</p>
				<p>Systems engineering is an iterative approach traditionally applied one-way, from the definition of the user needs to the implementation of a solution that satisfies certain requirements and is constrained by cost and schedule. This presentation instead aims at exploring the educational benefits of applying the opposite practice, thus retrieving system and subsystem level requirements based on a solution already implemented and taking advantage of the MBSE possibilities to realize a model of the system according to the ARCADIA method and systems engineering approach, using the Capella MBSE Tool. This reverse-engineering process has been applied to a renowned Space mission, the ESA Mars Express satellite, whose goal is to investigate all aspects of the martian environment, including the subsurface, surface and atmosphere of the planet, in order to search for evidence of extinct or extant life. The uppermost goal of this project is to demonstrate the benefits for university students at a Master's level keen on systems engineering in implementing the Capella tool to retrieve the system architecture and the operational processes in a "reversed" strategy. In this work, students have been compelled to apply systems engineering processes to justify the design choices and exploit the already well-known missions and capabilities to build the architecture and functional chains as a starting point for the reverse engineering of the identified subsystems. The results prove it is possible, and also recommendable time-wise, to teach Space engineering and Systems engineering students by using this inverse approach, rather than the canonic one in which students have to design a whole mission from scratch.</p>
