       Operational Analysis is the place to analyse, for each non-functional viewpoint, its&nbsp;context, constraints, opportunities, critical use cases, regulations, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, for safety viewpoint, feared events should be identified along with related operational scenarios and operational consequences to evaluate their criticality;

       Security viewpoint will focus on primary assets to be protected, threats and threat sources, feared events, all related to operational processes and scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beside this analysis work, operational simulation can help illustrate operational processes and scenarios captured in the operational analysis; it can be fed from these, and in turn can valuate or complement the analysis itself with simulation results.

     <td>
      <p>
       When the number of alternatives has been reduced by 'Explore Solution Space &amp; Alternatives' activity, the remaining ones are evaluated in a more precise manner, against most important fucntional and non-functional viewpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each engineering or architecture decision is to be submitted to multi-viewpoint analysis, so as to check that satisfyong one of them does not impede or degrade others (e.g. grouping functions on one execution node to optimise performance, could lead to introducing new common mode failure in the safety domain).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to be efficient, this analysis requires a short loop timing, so as to apply it at each major definition and design choice or decision. This means that the level of detail of architecture description and of analyses will stay at a relatively coarse grain. More in-depth analyses will be considered later in 'Perform Speciality or Discipline Analyses'.
      </p>
      <p>
       This approach mainly uses multi-purpose architecture analysis techniques and tools, in which constraints and golden rules of each discipline and speciality are checked accordingly.

     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       Once the candidate solution architectures are reduced to just one or&nbsp;a few, 'Perform multi-Disciplines Trade-off' ensures that a coarse grain, multi-viewpoint analysis, definition has reached a good compromise between all major viewpoints. But this coarse-grain analysis must be confirmed and deepened for each discipline and speciality, applying state-of-the-art approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is done in each domain, with fine-grain architecture and design descriptions, focused on one single viewpoint mainly; it uses dedicated speciality engineering methods and &nbsp;tools, along with simulation environments and models. These analyses and tools should be initialised by the common designed architecture description, sio as to ensure coherency and completeness of analyses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that this activity can also&nbsp;be run at any time when questions or&nbsp;issues arise regarding disciplines and specialities, including in early analysis if needed.
