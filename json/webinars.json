And to achieve the System Definition methodology the author decided to focus on first creating an Interface Control Document that consisted of high-level overview architecture of the target system CLEA (Digital Building Logbook) and the source system BDNB (Base de Données Nationale des Bâtiments).</p><p>However, the alternative architectures presented challenges such as how to validate the requirements at this stage. The chosen tool/technique was THALES (Model-Based System Engineering) – Capella Tool and Arcadia Methodology. The article presents this approach, which included: operational analysis, system needs analysis, logical architecture and discussions reflecting the physical architecture relating to the requirement phases of need understanding and solution architecture design.</p><p>The outcome of this presentation is The French Demonstration Preliminary Requirements and acknowledgement to the benefits of MBSE: Improved communications, Increased ability to manage system complexity, Improved product quality, Reduced Recycled Time, Reduced Risk, Enhanced knowledge capture and reuse of the information.</p>",

But what if it did not have to be this way?</p><p>At GU Orbit, we have adopted the Arcadia method exactly to make the process of engineering complex space systems more accessible to undergraduate students. With its multi-level workflow, repetitive activities, and opinionated semantics enforced by the Capella tool, it effectively guides even inexperienced users in the design of rational systems. Additionally, taking advantage of its semantic similarity to the European Space Agency's TASTE toolchain for embedded software development, we have devised an overarching methodology to rigorously bridge the gap between high-level system specifications and low-level component code.</p><p>This Arcadia-based method comprises the entire systems engineering lifecycle in a unified V-shaped model. The design phase is performed in Capella, regularly traversing all main functional decomposition levels. Specific physical-level views are then used to translate the resulting model into TASTE, trivialising the implementation phase down to individual lines of code in the Specification and Description Language (SDL, ITU-T Z.100) and C/C++. Finally, the verification and validation phases are carried out at all levels of abstraction by comparing specific TASTE-generated diagrams, such as State Chart Views and Message Sequence Charts (MSC, ITU-T Z.120), against their Capella-defined counterparts.</p><p>In this webinar, we will illustrate this method in the context of GU Orbit's student-led development of autonomous nanosatellite avionics, which were successfully demonstrated during an early stratospheric balloon flight.</p>",

            "descr": "<p>Architecture frameworks provide an approach to describing systems and the presentation of these elements and relationships to deliver the stakeholder needs. Essentially, frameworks provide templates for our engineering artefacts.</p><p>The design of a framework must accommodate a level of freedom in its usage; specific enough to answer the majority of stakeholder concerns, whilst generic enough to allow for differences between projects. This balancing act often results in framework design being more generic to allow for a wider audience. Having an untailored framework, which is more ‘open’, can lead to creating inconsistent viewpoints.</p><p>Arcadia is one such framework as implemented through the Capella tool. The framework provides 4 perspectives/levels for product definition:<ul><li>The Operational Analysis, where the user needs are considered. Note: no concept of the System at this level.</li><li>The System Analysis, where we define the contribution and scope of the System as a ‘black box’, identifying external interfaces, and top-level system functions.</li><li>The Logical Architecture, where we break the System down into logical ‘blocks’ and decompose the functionality.</li><li>The Physical Architecture, in which we define a (candidate) physical architecture, further decompose the functions, and deploy this functionality to the physical sub-systems, hardware, software and/or firmware.</li></ul></p><p>In this talk, we acknowledge the strengths of the Arcadia framework, and the benefits it brings, whilst considering the need to tailor the generic viewpoints. We will provide examples of how we have adopted the generic Arcadia framework and further specified some of the viewpoints to meet the needs of our stakeholders. We will discuss future work looking at how we can translate these specialisations across other areas of the model. Finally, we will provide some suggestions and advice on tailoring views to meet your own needs and ensuring stakeholder engagement with the model.</p>",

Its current challenge is to add 25 state-of-the-art nano-satellites to the existing system to enhance IoT capabilities and address new markets. In line with the CNES Capella experience, Kineis decided to build its “System Test” process on Capella.</p> <p>The extendibility and the flexibility of Capella nevertheless allowed them to carry on the previously initiated toolchain in order to cover the full process and support more use cases</p>",
